# **Types of Graphics**
1. **Playbook Stats Chart**

    This graph uses a cheese-cake graph to represent the distribution of playbooks with <span style="color: green;">**OK**</span> and <span style="color: red;">**FAILED**</span> results.
    Each section of the page shows the proportion of playbooks that have successfully detected vulnerabilities (OK) compared to those that have detected vulnerabilities (FAILED).

2. **Graph of Vulnerabilities by Severity**

    This graph uses a column graph to show the name of vulnerabilities found according to the severity data.
    The columns represent different severity levels: <span style="background-color: gray;">**None**</span>, <span style="background-color: green;">**Low**</span>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">**Medium**</span>, <span style="background-color: orange;">**High**</span>, <span style="background-color: red;">**Critical**</span>, allowing you to visualize how many vulnerabilities fall into each category.

## **Recommended Actions**
- **Review and Analysis**

>   - Users must carefully review the results of the playbooks to understand the vulnerabilities detected and the recommended steps to mitigate them.
>   - This review includes reading the generated reports in PDF and HTML formats to obtain a complete view of the system's security status.

- **Implementation of Remediations**

>   - Follow the suggestions provided to correct vulnerable configurations.
>  - Ensures the implementation of the recommended corrective measures for each vulnerability detected to minimize the risk.

- **Analyze Generated Reports**

>   - Read the description of each vulnerability, the rationale and the score provided to understand the associated risk.
>   - The reports provide detailed information that helps make informed decisions about necessary corrective actions.

- **Review of the Graphics**

>   - Regularly monitor the generated graphics in the “dashboards” directory.
>   - Graphic displays help identify trends and areas of concern in system security, allowing for proactive response.
