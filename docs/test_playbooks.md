# Test your contributions:
Once the playbooks have been created, you must perform the following tests:

1.-Verify Syntax and Format: Ensured that your playbooks comply with Ansible's syntax and style guidelines.
	
	ansible-lint <playbook_name>.yml

2.-Execution in test mode: Test the playbooks using Ansible's --check mode to make sure they work as expected without making changes to the system.
