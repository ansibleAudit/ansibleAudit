description: "The /etc/passwd file contains user account information that is used by many system 
utilities and therefore must be readable for these utilities to operate."
     
rationale: "It is critical to ensure that the /etc/passwd file is protected from unauthorized write
access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either
inadvertently or through malicious actions."
