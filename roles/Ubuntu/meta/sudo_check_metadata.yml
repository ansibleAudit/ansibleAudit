description: "sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as 
     specified by the security policy. The invoking user's real (not effective) userID is used to determine
     the user name with which to query the security policy."
     
rationale: "sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input output
     logging.Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy and I/O    
     loggingplugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end. The default security policy 
     is sudoers, which is configured via the file /etc/sudoers.The security policy          
     determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run sudo. The policy
     may require that users authenticate themselves with a password or another   
     authentication mechanism. If authentication is required, sudo will exit if the user's  
     password is not entered within a configurable time limit. This limit is policy-
     specific."
