description: "Avahi is a free implementation of Zeroconf networking, which enables devices on a     
     local network to automatically discover and communicate with each other without  
     requiring manual setup. It includes support for multicast DNS (mDNS) and DNS-
     Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD), allowing devices to publish and discover services and  
     hosts on the network seamlessly. With Avahi, users can easily find printers, files, 
     people, and other network services available on their local network without the need 
     for explicit configuration."
     
rationale: "Automatic discovery of network services is not normally required for system     
     functionality. It is recommended to remove this package to reduce the potential attack  
     surface."
